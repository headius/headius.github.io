I have worked as a Java developer — all the way up to the "Java EE architect" level — for over 20 years. For the last 13 years,
I've helped lead the JRuby project, which has forced me to learn more about JVM internals and programming language design than
I ever expected to learn. It's been a wild ride, and I hope to share what I've learned (and what I'm learning) with you.
