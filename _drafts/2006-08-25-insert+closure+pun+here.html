Yes, I have no clever closure-related title to give you. Call it a lack of inspiration. what I do have is a layman's guide to the Closures proposal by Gilad Bracha et al (or at least a Rubyist's guide).<br /><br />Closures provide a way to abstract out a small portion of an algorithm into client code; that is, the client of a larger algorithm can pass its small piece in to modify that algorithm in some way. The implications for managing and mutating collections should be apparent...if not, the ruby example of ["a", "b", "c"].each {|str| puts str} should make it clear in 37 characters of code. This is what the Closures proposal aims to add to standard Java. Yes, you read that right.<br /><br />Call this a brief survey of the paper in question, based on my understanding of closures in Ruby, my understanding of Java and the JVM, and my wide-eyed optimism for the evolving face of programming languages today. I may be wrong, so don't quote me as a definitive resource. I may be right, so don't discount me offhand.
