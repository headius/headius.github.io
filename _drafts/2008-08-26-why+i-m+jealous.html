Hi everybody! I thought I'd toss out a fluff post while we're finishing up JRuby 1.1.4. In this entry, I'll describe at least one reason why I'm jealous of all the other Ruby implementations. Ready? Here we go!<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">Rubinius</span><br /><br />This should be pretty obvious. Rubinius is a cool project, not only because it's trying to be "ruby in ruby" but because it has a lot of interesting challenges JRuby will never have to deal with. We'll never have to debug memory management or garbage collection or the lowest levels of an IO subsystem. Rubinius is cool because even though it's a complete reimplementation of Ruby, it's written largely in Ruby, and so most folks can hack on it. The recent move to C++ has tipped the scales away from Ruby a bit, but hopefully as things settle down more of that C++ code can be generated. In any case, I'm sometimes jealous of the "purity" and difficulty of Rubinius.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">Ruby 1.9 (YARV)</span><br /><br />I think my biggest reason to be jealous of YARV is that it's all but confirmed as the de-facto standard replacement for Ruby 1.8.x, regardless of what the rest of us do. Because it's been incorporated into the main Ruby codebase, YARV is essentially where Ruby is going, and no matter how well the rest of us do that development line will always be able to boast direct lineage from "classic Ruby". I'm also jealous that while implementing a new VM for Ruby, Koichi has had both the challenge and the advantage of keeping C extensions working, which makes it an easier migration for folks that depend on C extensions.<br />
