It's frustrating to see language wars in action.<br /><br />Over the past several days, there's been a firestorm of Groovy versus JRuby posts making the rounds. Some call for Sun to "drop JRuby support" or "leave Ruby out in the cold". Others claim "Groovy's not ready for the enterprise" when the poster's incorrect code doesn't work as expected. "JRuby is not a good thing happening to Java"..."In the LAMP world, Ruby comes dead last"...and so on. What a mess.<br /><br />I think it's time for a little reality check here.
