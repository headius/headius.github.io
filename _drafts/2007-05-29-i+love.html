Some nights I get contemplative. Sometimes it's too many beers. Sometimes it's too much time around like-minded geeks. Tonight, perhaps it's a bit of both. But there are things in this world I really love, and since I'm not shy about sharing, you all get to find out what they are.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">I Love My MacBook Pro</span><br /><br />I never was much for hardware evangelism, but I'm absolutely positive I'm more productive on my MacBook Pro, provided courtesy of Sun.

It's not just a visual experience...that would be a temporary attraction at best. It's the fact that it's unix, which I love, with a comfortable, pleasant UI. Linux doesn't have that yet. It's getting close, but it's just not as bright, clean, responsive, and above all...SEAMLESS. To the Linux GUI toolkit folks: look guys, if I can watch a widget rendering, you've failed miserably. Take that to heart...please.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">I Love Coding</span><br /><br />Of course I've written on this in the past, but it's really hard to talk about this too much. Coding in today's world is like having an infinite palette of colors to choose from, each
