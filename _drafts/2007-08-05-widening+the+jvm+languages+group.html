We need diversity in the <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/jvm-languages">JVM Languages group</a>, and it's been brought to my attention that some popular/key/interesting languages may not have representation. So we need to change that.<br /><br />If you are interested in the future of non-Java languages on the JVM, you should be on this list. Yes, we talk about a lot of JVM lanuage implementation challenges, we discuss compilers and stack frames and call-site optimizations, but we also talk about features peripheral to language implementation like package indexing and retrofitting Java 5+ code. We need your help.<br /><br />Once you've joined, or if you're already member, you have a second task: I respectfully request that each of you search out one individual you think would be interested in the list and try to get them involved. Toss them a quick email, invite them to describe their project or language or implementation to us, and promise them they're joining a very interesting and entertaining community :)
