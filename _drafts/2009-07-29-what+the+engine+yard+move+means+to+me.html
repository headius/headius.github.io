Hello friends!<br /><br />Now that the dust has started to settle, and press and twitter and blogosphere noise has started to quiet, and Slashdot comments have been moderated toward a rough semblance of sanity, I figured I'd tell my side of the story. I also figured I'd set the record straight on a few things.<br /><br />The Sun Era<br /><br />I loved working at Sun. I was proud to tell people, proud to wear Sun gear, proud to enter Sun offices around the world and be part of a global team. In late 2006, JRuby development had just started to hit its stride. We'd presented JRuby for the first time at JavaOne and shown a Rails application hobbling along--but working, nonetheless. In August, I'd spent some time talking to folks at Google about coming on board. I'd made it pass the early remote interviews and they were prepared to fly me out for my trial by fire. At the same time, Tim Bray of Sun Microsystems had started the wheels turning to get us hired at Sun. We had a few phone interviews with Sun, talking to Bob Brewin and Tor Norbye, and then it was decision time.<br /><br />I chose Sun. A lot of folks might have continued to pursue the Google angle, but I had been doing low-level web app development for almost a decade, and an entry-level position working on Hibernate and Tomcat-based webapps was not what I was looking for. I also knew that I'd have *less* time to work on JRuby, and I'd probably have to relocate to Silicon Valley. When Sun finally made their offer, we took it. We'd work on JRuby full time and support other Sun initiatives like NetBeans and GlassFish as needed. And so the Sun era of JRuby began.<br /><br />Now it's a common misconception that we received tremendous engineering support from Sun. We did not. We worked closely with NetBeans engineers working on editing and debugging, or with GlassFish engineers building multi-language support into GlassFish V3. At times we met with JVM engineers and traded ideas for how to improve JRuby. But the JRuby team at Sun never had more than two full-time people, Tom Enebo and myself. Later, when Project Kenai got started, our friend Nick Sieger came to Sun, but he was no more than 25% on JRuby and often a lot less. His primary job was Kenai.<br /><br />I'll state this again for anyone who missed it: JRuby never had more than 2.25 fulltime people at Sun. Keep that in mind.<br /><br />Not that we were bitter, though. Supporting "real" Sun products like NetBeans and GlassFish forced us to address a lot of gaps in JRuby's functionality, and there were times when we would receive patches from others at Sun. And of course we were happy to work substantially longer hours than we were required to; I estimate I'd done 4 years worth of work in the past 2.5 years, and I took exactly 5 days of vacation during that time. We were doing what we loved, and even though resources were tight, we were making great progress.<br /><br />About a year ago, we finally started pushing for Sun to assemble a commercial support offering for JRuby. We still receive requests from JRuby users for development or training assistance, prioritized bug support, and JRuby-friendly hosting options. So we entered into discussions with various of Sun's sales and support folks, brainstorming what a JRuby support offering might look like. It eventually became apparent that the only way we could offer support would be to attach it to an existing product with its own support offering, and GlassFish became that product.<br /><br />Tom and I were ready to start supporting JRuby commercially last summer. We knew it would start slow, with only a few contracts, and we were prepared to field any support issues that came in. For us, paid support would simply mean better prioritization of bug fixes, where previously the "noisiest" users got their issues resolved while the quiet ones got left behind. And so after a couple meetings, we were ready for commercial JRuby support.<br /><br />Then came a couple more meetings. And a couple more. Then we approached the holidays 2008 and delayed action until early 2009. Then we had to round people up for more meetings. All the while, the terms of support changed a bit to the left or right but basically stayed in a comfortable zone for Tom and I. Meetings, meetings, meetings, and still no support offering. Meanwhile, we had people almost begging to pay us for support, but we couldn't go around traditional support channels.<br /><br />It was incredibly frustrating.<br /><br />The last straw for me was when the Oracle buyout came along. Suddenly, regardless of whether we put a support offering in place or not, the future of that support was completely opaque. How could we offer a support contract to users if we didn't even know the future of those supported projects? And even worse, we weren't allow to make assurances about the future of those projects? I even got in trouble once because I said something like "I don't know anything about the future with Oracle, but since JRuby is open-source, I'm sure it will survive."<br /><br />Imagine you've got a great product that people are putting into production all over the world. You're at an OSS company who makes its money largely off hardware sales and software support. Imagine that you've followed all the protocols, dotted all the i's, watched your p's and q's, and spent a year trying to help that company monetize your project. You know there's a market, you have people asking for it, and after months of negotiation, you've still got nothing to offer. How would you feel?<br /><br />We had to do something.<br /><br />Enter Engine Yard<br /><br />Around December of 2008, after making the suggestion to Sun sales and marketing people, I went ahead and approached Engine Yard about supporting JRuby in their hosted environments. Along with support, our users frequently asked where they could host JRuby-based applications, and typical slices were usually inappropriate for a Java-based application. Discussions with Engine Yard went slowly, but we made progress. They were interested in JRuby, and they'd started to hear from more and more customers that wanted to use JRuby.<br /><br />In May, things started to pick up speed. They were hearing from more and more organizations that wanted JRuby support, or hearing that JRuby was the only way those organizations would consider using Ruby.
