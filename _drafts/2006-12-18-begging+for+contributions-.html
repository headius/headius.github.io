Hello from Rotterdam! I'll have a longer blog post once I'm stateside again about the Great JRuby European Tour, but for now...<br /><br />It seems that open source projects, developers, authors asking for (or simply receiving) monetary donations is the big ticket lately. Along those same lines, people often ask how they can help out JRuby. Well, here's a few simple ways:<br /><br /><ul><li>Run your Ruby apps against JRuby. Treat JRuby like a Ruby version you'll probably need to support in the future. Report bugs, or if you're Java-inclined, provide patches. Include JRuby in your periodic regression testing once your app or framework runs 100%. In short, do the same testing against JRuby you'd do against Ruby for Windows versus UNIX.</li><li>Join the mailing lists, become part of the JRuby community. We're very helpful and things are becoming very exciting in the JRuby world. There are a number of folks on the list contributing patches and using JRuby every day. There are others writing new libraries and applications based on JRuby's capabilities. There's endless possibility here, just waiting for folks like you to try it out.</li><li><br /></li></ul>
