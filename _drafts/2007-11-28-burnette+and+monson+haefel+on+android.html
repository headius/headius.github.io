I've noticed a couple Android posts from Richard Monson-Haefel have been answered by a post from Ed Burnette. Interesting points on both sides.<br /><br />First RMH asks  "Is Android Fragmentation Inevitable?", largely because certain portions of the API are optional. Here, he may have a point. One of the strengths of Java ME was the profiles; you could write for a specific set of APIs in a given profile and know your app would always work on other devices that support that profile. But it's early days for Android; I'd expect there would be certain compatibility levels established as things move along. Then he goes on to describe "Why Microsoft Loves Google's Android".
