I'd kept hearing Rubyists talk about how TextMate is so much smaller and uses so little memory compared with NetBeans, to the extent that they refused to switch. Of course there's other great reasons to use both TextMate and NetBeans, but this was often the last big thing keeping people from trying NetBeans. So I figured I'd run both side-by-side and do a few comparisons. I don't expect NetBeans to typically *beat* TextMate for size, because it has a lot more IDEish features built in, but the comparison should be interesting.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">Download Size</span><br /><br />TextMate: 9MB<br /><br />TextMate is an editor, so it's able to jam in quite a bit without having a very bulky size. For most languages, that's perfect...an editor is still pretty nearly all you'd ever need to work with Ruby or Python or PHP. But at least for Java, it falls short...say what you will about Java the language or Java the platform, but the features of Java IDEs are pretty hard to do without. At any rate, TextMate does very well here.<br /><br />NetBeans (OS X download sizes): 14MB for C/C++-only IDE, 16MB for PHP-only, 25MB for Java-only, 26MB for Ruby only IDE; 106MB for Web + Java EE, 140MB for everything<br /><br />NetBeans doesn't provide a "bare IDE" you can plug the other stuff into selectively, but instead splits the IDE up into specific language domains. If you're just doing run-of-the-mill Java SE work, you can get by with a svelte 25MB IDE that does almost as much as the incredibly fat 78MB Eclipse Java IDE download. If you only want Ruby, you can choose a 26MB download. Naturally, what I personally want is Java+Ruby only (and perhaps C/C++ for when I'm reading MRI source), but I usually end up downloading the "everything" version. And notice what it is that bumps up the size of the downloads: that blasted Java EE. When you stuff EE in there, you get an entire server (or two) plus all the APIs and docs and utilities that come with it. Schnikies. (Note to self: lobby for a dynamic download page where you can check the modules you want and download a customized bundle.)<br /><br />NetBeans ends up larger, but not looking too bad. For Ruby-only, 26MB gets you a lot. And presuming that the base IDE is somewhere around 10MB (guessing from the relative sizes) you could have a full-featured Java+Ruby or C+Ruby IDE in under 40MB. Nice. It's also worth noting that you can download any of the profiles and install the remaining bits you want through the Plugins feature.
