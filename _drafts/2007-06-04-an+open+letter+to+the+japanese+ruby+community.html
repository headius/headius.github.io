Hello Friends!<br /><br />For over a year now, we on the JRuby team have worked hard to create a Ruby implementation for the JVM compatible with Ruby 1.8. About a year ago, we got JRuby to run Rails in a very basic form. Today, we can run Rails very well, along with most other pure Ruby applications and libraries.
