Perhaps you've heard that NetBeans 6 is now available for download. I'm excited about this release for two reasons:<br /><ol><li>I work for Sun, so it's my part of job to be excited</li><li>It's an awesome leap forward for NetBeans, and I'm very happy using it<br /></li></ol>Before coming to Sun, I was an Eclipse user. Outside a few attempts to run NetBeans, I never strayed far. It did what I needed, even if it wasn't very pretty and had occasional (or sometimes frequent) PermGen explosions. It got the job done, and it was the cleanest, quickest, most complete Java IDE available.<br /><br />But times are changing.<br /><br />About 15 months ago, before I came to Sun, I published a series of blog posts entitled "Eclipse to NetBeans" where I listed all the problems I had getting up and going on NetBeans. You see, I was talking with Sun about a job at the time, and figured I needed to get my attack posts in before I accepted the position. So I fired away, and there was plenty to fire at. The list included a lot of items I figure any Eclipse user would run into, and I got a lot of great comments and emails on it.<br /><br />Today, over a year later, I'd like to revisit my lists of NetBeans pain points and show how many of them have been addressed. I think you're going to be very impressed, and I'm typing this before reviewing the list myself. I'm confident.<br /><br />Starting with <a href="http://headius.blogspot.com/2006/08/from-eclipse-to-netbeans-part-i.html">From Eclipse to NetBeans, Part 1</a>:<br /><ol><li>Anti-aliasing not on by default: Fixed.<br /></li><li>SVN in the default install: Fixed.</li><li>Multiple workspaces: Not addressed, and I'd still like it; but you can start NetBeans with a different set of projects pretty easily.</li><li>Repository management: Not addressed, but it's much closer now than it was before. I'm still looking for a versioning-system UI as tidy as Eclipse's classic CVS repository viewer (all the SVN viewers barely worked back then). For general project source control, though, NetBeans has come a long way.</li><li>Standard SVN repository logic: Again, not addressed, but perhaps in the future.</li><li>Deleting a project actually deleting it on the filesystem: Fixed.</li><li>Too many wizards: Fixed. The wizards are still there, but basically everything has a keyboard shortcut or single-step dialog now.</li><li>Show all files in Project view: Fixed, enough. The compromise appears to be that NB shows files in directories associated with source, which is quite enough for me. And the Files view shows everything. Basically on par with Eclipse as far as I'm concerned.</li><li>Browser selection should use platform defaults: Unconfirmed on Linux, but it works just right on OS X.</li><li>NetBeans is a goofy name for an IDE: Nothing anyone can do about this :). But it's no less descriptive than "Eclipse".</li><li>Keybindings for "find/goto class" and "find/goto file". Fixed. It turned out "Go To Type" already existed, and once I remapped it to what I want I was all set. And "Go To File" was added in a NetBeans 6 milestone build. Hooray!</li><li><br /></li></ol>
