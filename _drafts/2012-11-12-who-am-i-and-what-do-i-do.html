<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">"Why don't you introduce yourself..."<br /><br />"My name is Charles Oliver Nutter. I am a programmer."<br /><br />Is that enough?<br /><br />Most of the time, it's an acceptable answer. A lot of people tend to switch off when they find out someone works in a field they they're less familiar with. Some folks that work in a related field might dig a bit: "Do you build web sites? Are you a hacker? Can you help me with my phone?" (no, yes, and no). It's pretty rare that it goes any further, and I've often felt bad about that fact. You see, I'm very proud of what I do, and I don't think it's beyond the comprehension of anyone, if properly explained. And there's what I really love to do...explain things in a way anyone can understand. So...it's time to write.</div>
