<span style="font-weight:bold;">UPDATE: The correct date is May 19th</span><br /><br />After a crazy week at JavaOne, Tom and I will be settling in at the Chieftain in San Francisco to unwind. We'd love to have any JRuby enthusiasts stop by and chat a bit. <a href="http://www.bloglines.com/blog/ThomasEEnebo?id=17">Tom's blog</a> has all the details. RSVP if you like, so we we'll know to look for you, but show up regardless!
