Greetings!<br /><br /><a href="http://code.google.com/soc/2008">Google's Summer of Code for 2008</a> is starting up again, and we're looking for folks to submit proposals. The JRuby Community or Sun or me or someone will sign up as a mentoring organization, so start thinking about or discussing possible proposals. Here's a few ideas to get you started (and hopefully, there are many other ideas out there not on this list):<br /><ul><li>Writing a whole suite of specs for current Java integration behavior...and then expanding that suite to include behavior we want to add. This work would go hand-in-hand with a rework of Java Integration we're likely to start soon.</li><li>Collect and help round out all the profiling/debugging/etc tools for JRuby and get them to final releasable states. There's several projects in the works, but most of them are stalled and folks need better debugging. This project could also include simply working with existing IDEs (NetBeans, etc) to figure out how to get them to debug compiled Ruby code correctly (currently they won't step into .rb files).</li><li>Continue work on an interface-compatible RMagick port. There's already RMagickJR which has a lot of work into it, but nobody's had time to continue it. A working RMagick gem would ease migration for lots of folks using Ruby.</li><li>Putting together a definitive set of fine and coarse-grained benchmarks for Rails. JRuby on most benchmarks has been faster than Ruby 1.8.6...and yet higher-performance Rails has been elusive. We need better benchmarks and better visibility into core Rails. Bonus work: help nail down what's slower about JRuby.</li><li>Survey all existing JRuby extensions and put together an official public API based on core JRuby methods they're using. This would help us reduce the hassle of migrating extensions across JRuby versions.</li></ul>Please, anyone else who has ideas, feel free to post them here or on the mailing list for discussion. And if you have a proposal, go ahead and mail the JRuby dev list directly.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Update:</span></span> Martin Probst added this idea in the comments:<blockquote>Another idea might be to "fix" RDoc, whatever that means. That's not really JRuby centric, but still a very worthwhile task, I think.<br /><br />A documentation system that allows easy doc writing (Wiki-alike) and provides a better view on the actual functionality you can find in a certain instance would be really helpful. Plus a decent search feature.</blockquote>And that makes me think of another idea:<br /><ul><li>Add RDoc comments to all the JRuby versions of Ruby core methods, and get RI/RDocs generating as part of JRuby distribution builds. Then we could ship RI and have it work correctly. Ola Bini has already started some of the work, creating an RDoc annotation we can add to our Ruby-bound methods.<span style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-style: italic;"></span></span></li></ul><span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">Update 2:</span> sgwong in the comments suggested implementing the <a href="http://www.ruby-doc.org/stdlib/libdoc/win32ole/rdoc/index.html">win32ole library</a> for JRuby. This would also be an excellent contribution, since there's already libraries like <a href="http://danadler.com/jacob/">Jacob</a> to take some of the pain out of it, and it would be great to have it working on JRuby. And again, this makes me think of an few additional options:<br /><ul><li>Implement a full, compatible set of Apple Cocoa bindings for JRuby. You could use JNA, and I believe there's already Cocoa bindings for Java you could reuse as well, but I'm not familiar with them.</li><li>Complete implementation of the DL library (Ruby's stdlib for programmatic loading and calling native dynamic libraries) and/or Rubinius's FFI (same thing, with a somewhat tidier interface). Here too there's lots of help: I've already partially implemented DL using JNA, and it wouldn't be hard to finish it and/or implement Rubinius's FFI. And implementing Rubinius's FFI would have the added benefit of allowing JRuby to share some of Rubinius's library wrappers.<br /></li></ul>
