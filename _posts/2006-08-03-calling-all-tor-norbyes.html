Ok, perhaps the blogosphere can help with this one. I've been trying to respond to an email from Tor Norbye at Sun Microsystems since Sunday. Unfortunately, my emails seem to be shuffled off into the ether. He sent another email to me today, saying he hasn't heard back from me.<br />

<br />Tor! I'm right here! Give me an alternate way to contact you...your Sun address seems to be kaput.
