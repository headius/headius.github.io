I'm still decompressing a bit after a great conference and 14 hours of transit from London to San Jose, but blogs are starting to trickle in about RailsConf. Here's a <a href="http://claudia-und-mariano.net/articles/2006/09/15/railsconf-europe-2006-pizzaonrails">particularly notable entry</a>.<br /><br />I'm still not entirely sure why he wanted a picture of me with his (girl)friend. Maybe it's a German thing?<br /><br />I promise I'll get around to blogging more tomorrow. Time to de-lag and get some sleep before I'm pummeled with questions from Sun language and VM experts on Monday.
