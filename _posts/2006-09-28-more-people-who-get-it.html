There's been some good blogging lately related to dynamic languages and their future in a Java-based world. I'm glad there's smart folks out there who really get it; the JVM is a great piece of engineering, and the Java platform is as rich and feature-complete as anything out there. Combined with dyntyped languages, anything's possible.<br /><br /><a href="http://steve-yegge.blogspot.com/2006/09/bloggers-block-4-ruby-and-java-and.html">Steve Yegge: Ruby and Java and Stuff</a><br /><br />Steve calls out some of Ruby's gems, Java's failings, and seems to agree that Sun's making the right move pushing for broader language support on the JVM. Oddly enough, he never calls out JRuby specifically, even when mentioning Ruby, Java, and JVM scripting in the same paragraph. <a href="http://www.jruby.org">www.jruby.org</a>, Stevey.<br /><br /><a href="http://talklikeaduck.denhaven2.com/articles/2006/09/26/performance-anxiety">Rick DeNatale: Performance Anxiety</a><br /><br />Rick sums up a post on performance by <a href="http://duimovich.blogspot.com/2006/09/performance-is-not-optional.html">John Duimovich</a> nicely: dynamic languages absolutely do not have to be slow, and even a language as dynamic as Ruby should perform far better than it does today. Perhaps YARV will be the answer in the C world. I'll work my fingers to the bone making sure JRuby is the answer in the Java world.<br /><br /><a href="http://alex.dojotoolkit.org/?p=587#">Alex Russell: The Platform Strategy</a><br /><br />Alex sees what the world is starting to see: that Java the platform was the reason it won, not Java the language. The indivisible trinity of platform, language and JVM is a thing of the past, and developers will be better off as a result. Alex is also right about the JRuby hiring by Sun; it's a good first step that must be followed up by continuing and increasing action. You have my promise to do what I must to ensure that happens.
