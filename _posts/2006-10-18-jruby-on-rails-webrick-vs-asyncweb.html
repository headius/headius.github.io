Some fellow name TAKAI Naoto has posted an interesting comparison of JRuby on Rails running under WEBrick versus running under <a href="http://docs.safehaus.org/display/ASYNCWEB/Home">AsyncWeb</a>:<br /><br /><a href="http://recompile.net/2006/10/jruby_on_rails_webrick5rails_r.html">TAKAI Naoto compares WEBrick and AsyncWeb</a> and a comical <a href="http://translate.google.com/translate?u=http%3A%2F%2Frecompile.net%2F2006%2F10%2Fjruby_on_rails_webrick5rails_r.html&langpair=ja%7Cen&hl=en&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8&prev=%2Flanguage_tools">translation</a>.<br /><br />Although the numbers he shows for WEBrick seem *awfully* slow (4-6 seconds per request...we haven't been that slow since JavaOne running Rails in "development" mode) what's most interesting is the speed gains he gets from AsyncWeb: something like a five times improvement. If we assume there would be an improvement running a more recent JRuby (0.9.1 should be considerably faster than all previous versions) and running Rails in production mode...well, this thing starts to look real-world ready.<br /><br />He has a link to a snapshot...I'm investigating that now and will update this post when I know more.<br /><br />See also Takai's post about about JRuby on Rails running under AsyncWeb:<br /><br /><a href="http://recompile.net/2006/10/asyncweb_jruby_rails.htmlhttp://recompile.net/2006/10/asyncweb_jruby_rails.html">TAKAI Naoto running JRuby on Rails with AsyncWeb</a> and <a href="http://translate.google.com/translate?u=http%3A%2F%2Frecompile.net%2F2006%2F10%2Fasyncweb_jruby_rails.html&langpair=ja%7Cen&hl=en&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8&prev=%2Flanguage_tools">translation</a>.<br /><br />These sorts of things show real promise...AsyncWeb scales extremely well and is built upon Java's NIO library. A new contender enters the Rails front-ending competition!<br /><br /><span style="font-weight:bold;"><span style="font-style:italic;">Update:</span></span> Ok, I've spent five minutes looking at the code, and it's cooler than I thought. He's got AsyncWeb and JRuby on Rails wired together using Spring, and it's a trivial amount of code to do it...like less code than WEBrick. I hope he's able to get a release out for this soon.<br /><br />Here's a direct link to his <a href="http://recompile.net/uploaded_files/rails-asyncweb-0.0-SNAPSHOT.tar.gz">rails-asyncweb snapshot</a>. Super cool.
