Hey there JRubyists and JRubyists-to-be...if you're planning to be in Portland the evening of Thursday, May 29, there's going to be a sponsored JRuby hackfest for you!<br /><br />The event is going to be at the McMenamins Brewpub/Restaurant at the <a href="http://kennedyschool.com/">Kennedy School</a>. We'll have a room set aside for around 40ish people, so please <span style="font-weight:bold;">RSVP via email or comments</span>. There will be a taco bar and beers/beverages provided!<br /><blockquote><br />JRuby Hackfest!<br />Thursday, May 29, 6:30PM - whenever<br />McMenamins at the Kennedy School<br /><a href="http://www.mapquest.com/maps/mcmenamins:5736+N.E.+33rd+Ave.++Portland+or+97211/#a/maps/l:Mc+Menamin+Kennedy+School:5736+NE+33rd+Ave:Portland:OR:97211:US:45.564088:-122.630649:address:/m::12:45.564088:-122.630649:0::/io:0:::::f:EN:M:/e">5736 N.E. 33rd Ave.<br />Portland, OR 97211</a></blockquote><br />We're pushing this event as a real hackfest, so bring your laptops and apps you are running or want to run on JRuby. At least Tom Enebo, Nick Sieger, Ola Bini and I will be there, so we'll probably be able to get you up and running. Otherwise, if you don't have an app, stop by and we'll give you a walkthrough of JRuby and maybe there will be a bug or piece of code you can help out with.<br /><br />I want to thank <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/">LinkedIn</a> for initiating this event...Tom and I and the other JRubyists are too busy to set these sorts of things up, so it's great to have community members take this initiative. LinkedIn is also sponsoring, along with <a href="http://www.joyent.com/">Joyent</a> and <a href="http://www.sun.com">Sun Microsystems</a>.<br /><br />Remember, please <span style="font-weight:bold;">RSVP in comments or by email</span> so we can get an idea of headcount. And if you have any suggestions for things you'd like to see or hear about or work on at the 'fest, let us know!
