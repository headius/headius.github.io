July 17 was a particularly big news day for JRuby. Three articles were posted, one in two places, on JRuby and the two core developers Tom and I. I present here a collection of articles and blogs that have particular significance to the Ruby+Java world.<br />

<br /><span style="font-weight:bold;"><a href="http://www.javaworld.com/javaworld/jw-07-2006/jw-0717-ruby.html">Ruby for the Java world</a><br />Joshua Fox - JavaWorld - July 17, 2006</span><br /><br />Joshua Fox provides a brief introduction to Ruby and demonstrates Ruby on Java using JRuby. Joshua corresponded with Tom and I about this article, and I think the end result turned out well.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight:bold;"><a href="http://www.linuxjournal.com/node/1000061">Interview: JRuby Development Team</a><br />Pat Eyler - Linux Journal - July 17, 2006</span><br /><br />Pat put together a great set of questions and we told all in this 3800-word interview. I'm awaiting the flames from my response to "What's next for Ruby".<br /><br /><span style="font-weight:bold;"><a href="http://www.oreillynet.com/ruby/blog/2006/07/interviewing_the_jruby_develop.html">Interviewing the JRuby Developers</a><br />Pat Eyler - O'Reilly Ruby - July 17, 2006</span><br /><br />The same interview from above, trimmed for length and posted to the O'Reilly Network.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight:bold;"><a href="http://infoq.com/news/JRuby-Leaves-SourceForge">JRuby Leaves SourceForge for Greener Pastures at Codehaus</a><br />Obie Fernandez - July 17, 2006</span><br /><br />Obie covers our move from SourceForge to Codehaus, quoting Tom and I venting our frustration over multiple downtimes (including the infamous week-long CVS outage <span style="font-style:italic;">right before JavaOne</span>.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight:bold;"><a href="http://www.internetnews.com/dev-news/article.php/3609256">A Gem Of A Language for Java and .NET</a><br />Andy Patrizio - May 26, 2006</span><br /><br />Andy released this article shortly after our JavaOne press conference appearance. He provides a good executive summary of Ruby, IronRuby, and JRuby.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">Ugo Cei on Ruby/Java Integration</span><br /><br />In addition, I was today pointed to Ugo Cei's series of blog postings on Ruby/Java integration. They're short, but give a good quick overview of what works and what doesn't. Covered topics include the Ruby/Java bridges RJB (worked, but looks cumbersome) and YAJB (did not work), JRuby (worked like gangbusters, naturally ;), and remoted Java code over XML-RPC (a fairly popular recommendation from Rubyists).<br /><br /><a href="http://agylen.com/2006/01/23/ruby-for-java-programmers-part-i/">Part I</a> - RJB part 1<br /><a href="http://agylen.com/2006/01/25/ruby-for-java-programmers-part-ii/">Part II </a>- RJB for a more complicated case<br /><a href="http://agylen.com/2006/01/26/ruby-for-java-programmers-part-iii/">Part III</a> - YAJB...OutOfMemory on a simple script<br /><a href="http://agylen.com/2006/02/08/ruby-for-java-programmers-part-iv/">Part IV</a> - JRuby, a great comparison to the second RJB posting<br /><a href="http://agylen.com/2006/02/27/ruby-for-java-programmers-part-v/">Part V</a> - XML-RPC part 1<br /><a href="http://agylen.com/2006/05/06/ruby-for-java-programmers-part-vi/">Part VI</a> - XML-RPC part 2<br /><br />Ugo will also be speaking at OSCON on <a href="http://conferences.oreillynet.com/cs/os2006/view/e_sess/8636">Ruby for Java Programmers</a>, which is great since our own proposal was <span style="font-style:italic;">rejected</span>.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight:bold;"><a href="http://jruby.codehaus.org/JRuby+in+the+News">JRuby in the News</a></span><br /><br />Our Codehaus page will track articles as they're published. If you know of good blog entries or articles we should include here, please let me know!
