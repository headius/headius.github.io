Tom and I are giving our JRuby on Rails talk twice at JavaOne next week, and while wrestling with <a href="http://www.cplan.com/javaone2007/schedulebuilder">ScheduleBuilder</a> I discovered something surprising: the thursday session is already FULL! Perhaps I underestimated how many people would be interested in seeing us prattle on about the future of Java web development with Rails. I expected that two sessions was extremely optimistic of the scheduling committee. It appears I was quite wrong!<br /><br />If you haven't signed up for the JRoR session yet, you better do it quick. I'd hate for any of my regular readers to miss out on attending the session. It's gonna be a great show!
