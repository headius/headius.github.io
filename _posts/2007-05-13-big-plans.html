I just came across this amusing entry from an old, now-defunct blog of mine on LiveJournal.<br /><br />The last line pretty much says it all. I must have been really frustrated with my job at the time:<br /><blockquote><a href="http://headius.livejournal.com/14012.html">Someone should pay me to sit at home and do great things.</a></blockquote>(If you don't get the joke: I now work for Sun Microsystems, at home, on JRuby...so if JRuby's ever considered a "great thing", the prophecy will be fulfilled.)<br /><br />And yes, I've seen the <a href="http://money.cnn.com/magazines/fortune/fortune_archive/2007/05/28/100033867/">Microsoft news</a>. I'd hate to be an OSS developer or apologist at Microsoft today. If Sun did something like this I'd resign.
