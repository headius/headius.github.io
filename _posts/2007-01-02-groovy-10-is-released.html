Congratulations to the Groovy team on their release of Groovy 1.0! Groovy is another dynamic language for the JVM inspired by features in Smalltalk, Python, and of course Ruby. It's been a long time coming, and a lot of hard work involved, but Groovy 1.0 is finally here.<br /><br />See the <a href="http://docs.codehaus.org/display/GROOVY/2007/01/02/Groovy+1.0+is+there">announcement from Guillaume Laforge</a>, one of the Groovy team members.<br /><br />Here's hoping there's a bright future of cooperation between the Groovy team and the other dynamic languages for the JVM.
