It's that time of year again, and the call for papers for JavaOne and CommunityOne is closing soon! We're hoping for a lot more diverse JRuby presentations and speakers this year, so don't think you have to be doing Rails to get in. There's room for GUI dev, Game dev, automation, services, anything you might be doing with JRuby. So don't miss the deadline, and consider submitting a couple talks if you have a couple good topics!<br /><br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">CommunityOne</span><br />CommunityOne East - March 18-19, 2009 - New York City<br />CommunityOne West - June 1-2, 2009 - San Francisco<br />Deadline to submit speaking abstracts: Dec. 11, 2008<br />Where to make submissions: <a href="http://www.eventreg.com/sun/communityone09/cfp">Click Here</a><br />Event Details (external): <a href="http://developers.sun.com/events/communityone/">Click Here</a><br />Questions/Inquiries: <a href="mailto:communityone-info@sun.com">communityone-info@sun.com</a><br /><br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">JavaOne</span><br />JavaOne - June 2-5, 2009 - San Francisco<br />Deadline to submit speaking abstracts: December 19, 2008<br />Where to make submissions: <a href="http://www28.cplan.com/cfp_prod/CFPLogin.jsp?wId=69MQ81">Click Here</a><br />Even Details (external): <a href="http://java.sun.com/javaone/">Click Here</a><br />Questions/Inquiries: <a href="mailto:j1papers@sun.com">j1papers@sun.com</a><br /><br />Submit early!
