See, here's the deal. I'm not a very advanced IDE user. I used Eclipse for years and JDE before that, and I wouldn't ever have considered myself a "pro" with either. I learned what I needed to get the job done and not a whole lot else. Beyond that I never knew some of the coolest features, and was never so good at convincing people to make a switch. This actually has helped my migration to NetBeans, since it basically does all the things I was used to in Eclipse. But it has been problematic when I try to convey how cool the new NetBeans Ruby support really is.<br /><br />It's super cool. It does things I've not seen any other IDE or editor do.<br /><br />However, it's best not to take my advice, and <a href="http://blogs.sun.com/roumen/entry/two_demos_jruby_on_rails">Roumen Strobl</a> has recorded two seriously excellent demonstrations of Rails and Ruby support in NetBeans. They make the sale way better than I could (though I now have many good ideas for how to sell it better in the future).<br /><br />If you have any interest in Ruby editors or IDEs, you should take the time and watch these, especially the Ruby support.<br /><br /><a href="http://blogs.sun.com/roumen/entry/two_demos_jruby_on_rails"><b>Two Demos: JRuby on Rails and Advanced Ruby Editing in NetBeans!</b></a>
