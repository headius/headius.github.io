There's now a complete transcript of my <a href="http://rosl.iandb.net/presentations/jruby/JRuby%20Presentation%2018%20Oct%2006.html">JRuby presentation for the Rubyists of Second Life</a> complete with my slides and all the inter-avatar discussion. It's raw and it's real, and it was a lot of fun.<br /><br />Larry the Liquid has also posted a <a href="http://www.larrytheliquid.com/2006/10/29/jruby-of-second-life-recap/">JRuby of Second Life Recap</a> that gives readers a good idea what it was like to "be there" and has a few photos to show it off. I'm the one standing down by the screen, and though you can't really tell, I'm wearing a JRuby t-shirt.<br /><br />If only it were as cheap and easy to print t-shirts in Real Life as it is in Second Life...
