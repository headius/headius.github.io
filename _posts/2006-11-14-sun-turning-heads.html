Thijs van der Vossen posts an interesting perspective on <a href="http://www.fngtps.com/2006/11/recommending-sun">recommending Sun</a> and how his opinion of the company has been changed by recent events. It seems that the truth is really getting out: Sun "gets it" and is rising again as a great innovator.<br /><br />It's a great time to be here.
