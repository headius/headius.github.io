We're on for the second meeting of the<a href="http://twincitiesrb.com"> Twin Cities Ruby Users Group</a> (official name pending). The details are available on the group's home page, but the basics are that it's at Digital River in Eden Prairie, Minnesota, on January 31st at 7:30PM CST. We're hoping to have a big turnout, so if you're in the area, please come!<br />

<br />If you would be interested in presenting at one of our meetings, let me know and I'll put you in touch with the appropriate folks. Thank you!
