Sun is running an "Ask the Experts" session on Ruby/JRuby support in NetBeans 6(.1) with myself, Tor Norbye, and Brian Leonard. If you've had questions about NetBeans Ruby support you'd like answered, but haven't had a chance to ask...here's your opportunity.<br /><br />The main page is here: <a href="http://java.sun.com/developer/community/askxprt/">Ask the Experts</a><br /><br />Fire away! You have all this week to get your questions in.
