<a href="http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/message.php?msg_id=38176533">The Phoenix Is Rising</a>!<br /><br />After being considered dead for many years, Jython is back in business with the beta 1 release of Jython 2.2. It's been teetering on the edge of 2.2 compatibility for a long time, but over the past several months the core team and several contributors have rounded off the edges, to the point that a beta release of the long-awaited 2.2 version is now available.<br /><br />For all you Pythonistas, this should mean two things:<br /><br />- You have a project for the day. Go get Jython 2.2, try it out with your Python 2.2-compatible apps and libraries, and report any issues you find.<br />- Start contributing your time, either helping with the Java coding, helping to debug Python apps and libraries, or help on efforts to write C-based libraries in Python.<br /><br />I will also remind you that a large percentage of JRuby's success is due entirely to its community. Can you really get up in the morning and look at yourself in the mirror without knowing you've helped Jython get back up to speed? Can you?
