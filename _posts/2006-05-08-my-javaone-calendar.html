I've entered all the sessions I'm planning to attend into Google Calendar, available at the following URLS:<br /><br />- <a href="http://www.google.com/calendar/feeds/1tjavsgod7m83kvdut3vmlp6is@group.calendar.google.com/public/basic">RSS</a><br />- <a href="http://www.google.com/calendar/ical/1tjavsgod7m83kvdut3vmlp6is@group.calendar.google.com/public/basic">ICal</a><br />- You can search for "Headius at JavaOne" in GCal too. <br /><br />These are negotiable if there's folks out there that want to grab a lunch, dinner, or 30 minutes and a cup of coffee. Do let me know: <a href="mailto:headiusREMOVEME@REMOVEMEheadius.com">email</a><br /><br />I'm arriving late Monday and leaving late Saturday...the rest is on the calendar.
