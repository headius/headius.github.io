A couple interesting "Bossies" were awarded by InfoWorld this week:<br /><ul><li><a href="http://www.infoworld.com/article/07/09/10/37FE-boss-programming-language_1.html">Best Open Source Programming Language</a> - Summary: <a href="http://www.ruby-lang.org">Ruby</a> gets mad props for a vibrant community and a diverse range of implementations (e.g. <a href="http://www.jruby.org">JRuby</a>), and then they go squishy and say "and these other languages are great too!"</li><li><a href="http://www.infoworld.com/article/07/09/10/37FE-boss-software-development_1.html">Best Open Source IDE</a> - InfoWorld heaps praise on <a href="http://www.netbeans.org">NetBeans</a> largely because it has *not* gone the way of an amorphous, all-encompassing "platform" and has continued to take risks to improve the overall experience of the IDE. Before the work on <a href="http://www.netbeans.org/community/releases/60/index.html">NetBeans 6</a> (don't download M10; use a <a href="http://bits.netbeans.org/download/6.0/nightly/">daily build</a>) I was a nay-sayer myself; having used NetBeans 6 for many months now, I can honestly say it's far better than NetBeans 5.5 and has caught up or passed Eclipse in many ways. There's more to do, but I'm extremely impressed with the progress.</li></ul>I try not to be too much of a Sun marketing shill, but both Bossies are pretty close to my heart. JRuby has been my passion for three years now, and NetBeans has taken a serious about face with greatly improved Java support and best-in-class Ruby support. It's good to see some recognition for hard work.
