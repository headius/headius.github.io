It's official! Travel arrangements are currently being made for me to attend and present at RailsConf Europe 2006 in London!<br /><br />I had not expected to make it, so this comes as a bit of a surprise. I guess I need to put together some sort of presentation now, don't I? Oh, and make sure I'm happy enough with JRuby's Rails support to be comfortable...<br /><br />I'll take comments on this off-the-top-of-my-head agenda:<br /><ul><li>Who Am I</li><li>What is JRuby (dime tour, nothing too deep)</li><li>Why Rails on JRuby (probably a few slides on JDBC, alt persistence layers, EJB integration, legacy code integration, why JRuby is better in some ways than Ruby)</li><li>Why not Java-based web framework X</li><li>Demos</li><li>What doesn't work</li><li>What's next, future plans, how can you help</li><li>Q/A</li></ul>I'm also hoping the JRubyist Mongrelites are able to get things working before then. I'll probably try to help them, wrap up enough bugs so that most walkthroughs in AWDwR work nicely, and create the presentation over the next two weeks.<br /><br />I hope to see you in London!<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">P.S.</span> If anyone wants to give me any pointers on travel from the US to the UK, please do. I'll be travelling alone and I've never been across the pond. Thankfully, I already have my passport, but other than that I'll be flying blind. If any Brits feel like taking me under their wing once I arrive (or just grabbing a pint or two), that would also be much appreciated. I plan to arrive during the evening of the 13th, flying back the morning of the 16th.
