Huzzah! Java 6 has been approved by the JCP. The final results on <a href="http://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=270">JSR 270</a> show that the voting was <a href="http://jcp.org/en/jsr/results?id=4051">13 for, none opposed, with three not voting</a>. As I understand it, this is the final step toward officially releasing Java 6 to the masses.<br /><br />Java 6 is really an incredible piece of software. Once again the Sun engineers have boosted performance--in some JRuby benchmarks by as much as 20%. Beyond that, they've include the first round of native platform scripting support in the form of <a href="http://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=223">JSR 223</a>, a scripting API intended to replace and improve upon the Bean Scripting Framework. Java 6 also includes native support for Javascript in the form of <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/rhino/">Rhino</a>, just about the fastest mainstream JavaScript engine available.<br /><br />Honestly, give Java 6 a shot. I've been using it constantly because of the performance gains, and <a href="https://scripting.dev.java.net/">JRuby support for 223</a> is already available. This is the first Java release during my time at Sun, and I'm extremely proud to be a part of this team.
