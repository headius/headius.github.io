Upcoming event round-up!<br /><ol><li>Next weekend, Tom Enebo, Nick Sieger and I will be at PyCon, checking out all the pythony goodness and hooking up with the Jython guys for some hacking.</li><li>Tom and I will travel to Prague for Euruko 2008, the European RubyConf. We'll present JRuby, unsurprisingly, and hopefully meet up with more European Rubyists we haven't talked to before.</li><li>After Euruko, Tom and I will be in Edinburgh for Scotland on Rails. We're supposed to do a 90-minute talk about JRuby on Rails. We'll try to make it entertaining and informative.<br /></li></ol>
