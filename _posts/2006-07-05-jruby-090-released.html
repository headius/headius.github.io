And it's out the door! We are currently sending out the announcement: JRuby 0.9.0 is released!<br />

<br />Any frequent readers out there will know there's a ton of improvements in this release. I'll be blogging a bit later on the details of each, but here's a short list:<br /><ul><li>All non-native Ruby libraries (lib/ruby/1.8 from the C version) are included in this release, so you can download, unpack, and hit the ground running. No installing, no copying files, no fuss.</li><li>RubyGems 0.9.0 (coincidence?) is included pre-installed with appropriate scripts to run with JRuby. Gems install beautifully, but I'd recommend you use --no-rdoc and --no-ri until we get a few performance issues worked out (doc generation is still pretty slow).</li><li>WEBrick finally runs and can serve requests. This also allows the Rails 'server' script to server up your Rails apps. Speaking of Rails...</li><li>Ruby on Rails now runs most scripts and many simple applications out-of-the-box. The 1.1.4 release of Rails included our patch for block-argument assignment, eliminating an unsupported (by JRuby) and unusual syntax preventing scripts from running. We've also improved performance a bit and as mentioned before, got the WEBrick-based 'server' script running well.</li><li>YAML parsing, StringIO, and Zlib are now Java-based instead of the original pure-Ruby implementations. This has greatly improved the performance of RubyGems and other libraries/apps that make use of these libraries. There are a few libraries remaining to be "nativified" and we expect to get future performance benefits from doing so.<br /></li><li>As always, there are a large number of interpreter, core, and library fixes as part of this release.</li></ul>This release represents another huge leap forward beyond our JavaOne demo. Where Rails was a bit touchy and unpredictable with that release, it's now becoming very usable. Where RubyGems only half-worked before, it now appears to work well every time. We feel we're on track for full Rails support by the end of this summer, with a JRuby 1.0 release to follow. Thanks all for your support and assistance!<br /><br />Special thanks to JRuby contributors Ola Bini and Evan Buswell for their work on YAML/Zlib reimplementation and server sockets, respectively. We wouldn't have RubyGems or WEBrick working without their contributions.<br /><ul><li>Information about JRuby and the release can be found at <a href="http://www.jruby.org">jruby.org</a>.</li><li>The release archives are on <a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=35413">SourceForge</a>. This will be the last release from SourceForge; we are in the process of moving to <a href="http://jruby.codehaus.org/">CodeHaus</a> and should be up and running there shortly!</li></ul>Stay tuned for a <span style="font-weight: bold;">JRuby on Rails</span> walkthrough!
