<span style="font-weight:bold;"><a href="http://rubyconfmi.org/">RubyConf*MI</a></span><br /><br />I am registered for RubyConf*MI, though it's still uncertain if I'll attend. The registration cost is a measly $20, but it sounds like it will be a good time. Grand Rapids is about a 9-hour drive, however, so I'm looking for someone to share transportation with from Minneapolis. I probably won't go if it's just me alone.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight:bold;"><a href="http://barcamp.org/MinneDemo">MinneDemo</a></span><br /><br />I'll be doing a quick (<15 mins) JRuby demo at Minnesota's first DemoCamp. I have no idea what I'll demo yet, but perhaps a more elaborate IRB-based Swing demo like that I did at JavaOne.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight:bold;"><a href="http://europe.railsconf.org/">RailsConf Europe</a></span><br /><br />Various events that are in mostion and which I won't elaborate on may lead to me attending and presenting at RailsConf Europe. Hopefully those events pan out (and hopefully there's enough time between now and the conf to get Rails working suitably well).<br /><br /><span style="font-weight:bold;"><a href="http://www.rubyconf.com/">RubyConf</a></span><br /><br />I may not be presenting, but I shall attend! I managed to secure one of the coveted registrations before they sold out two hours later. Regardless of corporate reimbursement, I'm going to make the trek to Denver. I hope to do an unofficial or "lightning" session on JRuby as well, since I know there are many attendees interested in hearing about it.
