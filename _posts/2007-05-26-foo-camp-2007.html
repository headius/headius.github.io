I've been invited to this year's <a href="http://wiki.oreillynet.com/foocamp07/index.cgi">Foo Camp</a>. Since it sounds like a great time and there's a bunch of other folks going I'd like to talk to, I'm accepting the invitation. My purpose posting this entry is to let other campers know I'll be there and try to hook up and chat a bit beforehand. So drop me a line...firstname.lastname@sun.com.<br /><br />FYI, if any other campers are coming up from Oakland, I'm renting a car. My times are listed on the "Rides Offered" page.<br /><br />I'm looking forward to a fun weekend!
