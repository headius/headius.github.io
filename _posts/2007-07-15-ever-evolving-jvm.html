<a href="http://blogs.sun.com/jrose/">John Rose</a>, lead of the "invokedynamic" effort (<a href="http://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=292">Java Specification Request 292</a>), has posted some exciting articles about the future of the JVM and a number of changes potentially for the next Java version. Among these is, of course, the dynamic invocation efforts, but these entries include information on non-local returns from closures, tail calls, and tuple support. I'm excited to have John as a co-worker and to be helping out the invokedynamic effort in my own small way by working on JRuby's compiler. John has also provided guidance on how to make a dynamic language fast on current JVMs, which has informed much of my compiler's design.<br /><br />Check out his articles:<br /><br /><a href="http://blogs.sun.com/jrose/entry/longjumps_considered_inexpensive">Longumps Considered Inexpensive</a><br /><a href="http://blogs.sun.com/jrose/entry/tail_calls_in_the_vm">tail calls in the VM</a><br /><a href="http://blogs.sun.com/jrose/entry/tuples_in_the_vm">tuples in the VM</a><br /><br />It's going to be a fun year for language developers on the JVM!
