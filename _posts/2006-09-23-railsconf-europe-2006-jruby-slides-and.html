I have posted my slides and demo on headius.com at the following URLs. The demo has some very basic instructions for getting it to work, but I don't plan to support this code in any way. It was fairly hacked together in the days before the conference, so you're on your own getting it working. Whether you can run it or not, however, it's fairly illustrative in how it accesses EJBs, javax.persistence entities, and JMX resources. A taste of things to come.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.headius.com/~headius/JRubyOnRails-RailsConfEurope2006.zip">JRuby On Rails - RailsConf Europe 2006 (Keynote, original)</a> <span style="font-weight:bold;">Update: Fixed the URL</span><br /><a href="http://www.headius.com/~headius/JRubyOnRails-RailsConfEurope2006.pdf">JRuby On Rails - RailsConf Europe 2006 (PDF)</a><br /><a href="http://www.headius.com/~headius/JRubyOnRails-RailsConfEurope2006.odp">JRuby On Rails - RailsConf Europe 2006 (OpenDoc Presentation)</a><br /><a href="http://www.headius.com/~headius/JRubyOnRails-RailsConfEurope2006.ppt">JRuby On Rails - RailsConf Europe 2006 (PowerPoint)</a><br /><br /><a href="http://www.headius.com/~headius/RailsConfDemo.tar.bz2">JRuby on Rails Demo (.tar.bz2)</a>
