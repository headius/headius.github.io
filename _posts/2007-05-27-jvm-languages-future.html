I've started a Google Group for all those interested in the future of alternative languages (i.e. not Java) on the JVM. A number of you knew this was coming, and I've already invited folks that expressed an interest in my RedMonk Unconference session at JavaOne. The rest of you are also invited.<br /><br />Please plan to talk shop about language implementation strategies, pain points on the JVM, and what we can do to build a common set of libraries, frameworks, and patterns to ease and improve the Java platform's support for many languages. The time for action is now, my friends, and we have a wealth of information across all our language projects to draw from. We must come together to build a stronger base for everyone to stand upon.<br /><br /><a href="http://groups.google.com/group/jvm-languages">I welcome you to the future.</a>
