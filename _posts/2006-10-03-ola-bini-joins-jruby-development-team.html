We're proud and excited to announce that <a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&ct=res&cd=1&url=http%3A%2F%2Fola-bini.blogspot.com%2F&ei=MfUiRaKFNqWsigHEsOCVCQ&sig=__2or4ZfLw7B8hXcQe601POoNgn4M=&sig2=4hsEed1b4OiYKhKJ1qyF6g">Ola Bini</a> has officially joined the JRuby development team. Ola has proven to be one of the most valuable community contributors to JRuby, and he's shown that he's dedicated to making Ruby on the JVM a reality. He's the sole creator of the RbYAML and JvYAML projects that have enabled high-performance YAML support in JRuby, he single-handedly implemented Enumerable in Java, he has been the primary developer behind our Zlib support, and he's contributed numerous patches and fixes over the past 8 months.<br /><br />Thank you Ola for all your help, and welcome to the team!
