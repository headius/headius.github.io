I should have tossed this in a blog entry earlier, but perhaps it's not too late.<br /><br />I will be presenting JRuby to the Rubyists of Second Life this evening at 6PDT. Here's the announcement sent to Ruby-Talk, which has all the relevant info:<br /><a href="http://www.ruby-forum.com/topic/83839"><br />JRuby at Rubyists of Second Life</a><br /><br />I hope you'll stop by and join in the conversation. I'll have a set of slides, but more importantly I'll be available for discussions on JRuby, Ruby, Java, and their future together. I'm "Headius Exodus" in SL. See you there!
