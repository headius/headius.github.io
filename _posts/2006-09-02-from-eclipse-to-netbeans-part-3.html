I got a lot of good tips from NetBeans developers and users about how to resolve some of the issues I ran into. A number of them, as I mostly expected, were related to my running a beta that's still under development. Others are resolved via modules and add-ins (that in many cases should perhaps be included as standard). And still other cases are resolved or scheduled to be resolved in NetBeans 6. So to be fair, I decided to continue my NetBeans adventure by diving to the bleeding edge of NetBeans: building directly from source and running JDK 1.6 Beta 2.<br /><br />I won't go into the details, but getting NetBeans to build was an extremely simple matter (thanks to Tor Norbye from Sun). Set CVSROOT, checkout -P standard, cd nbbuild, ant. It's really that simple. I did need to up the maximum memory needed for ant, but that was a minor issue. After the build, I found "ant tryme" that starts up NetBeans, and I was off and running.<br /><br />This article will be a short wrap-up of issues from Part 1, revisited based on tips, tricks, and NetBeans 6 current and planned features. Hopefully it will demonstrate to potential switchers that NetBeans has really turned a corner. I'll revisit Part 2 in the next article.<br /><br />I used to be among the NetBeans detractors...and for good reason; NetBeans had a rocky start. But I'm rapidly growing fond of it, especially using NetBeans 6.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">Salvation</span><br /><br />I'll take the items from Part 1 point-by-point. There's some useful links inline as well, so feel free to skim this list for issues of particular interest to you.<br /><ol><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Antialiasing</span> - RESOLVED! When running under JDK 1.6, all text elements are immediately antialiased according to the host platform's settings. No additional configuration changes are needed.</li><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">SVN by default</span> - RESOLVED, I think. My basic pull of NetBeans 6 from CVS included SVN support immediately. I believe it's intended to be in the full release by default as well.</li><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Workspaces</span> - OPEN. My main use for workspaces is to keep different sets of projects in different places, and to a lesser extent to have different configurations for those sets. No obvious support for this in NetBeans 6 yet.</li><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Separate repository view</span> - OPEN. Eclipse's repository view is a godsend when you're hunting around for projects, tags, and branches, or if you want to do any remote repository management. I still miss it, and there's no out-of-the-box support in NB 6 for a repository view.</li><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Standard SVN layout support</span> - OPEN. I would like NetBeans to understand what "trunk", "tags", and "branches" dirs in SVN are used for.</li><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Delete project not deleting files</span> - OPEN. I tried to delete a working copy locally and the files remained on disk.</li><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Wizarditis</span> - OPEN. The best example of this is perhaps the SCM wizard, where at least seven clicks are required for me to check out my JRuby branch. If I had a repository view, it might take three or four.</li><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Show non-project files in project view</span> - OPEN, but not a big deal. I've gotten accustomed to just using the Files view when I need access to non-Java source. I still think it's necessary to show other files in the project view, but it hasn't gotten in my way as much as I thought it might.</li><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Settings dialog search</span> - OPEN, but improving. I remember once being told that if people need to use a site map or search for your site, you're doing something wrong. NetBeans should actually be applauded for presenting common settings in a novice dialog and a full complement of expert settings a button-press away. In NB6, they appear to be moving some of the important advanced settings to the main dialog as well. It's a balancing act, but I think a lot of people will appreciate the easy dialog.</li><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Browser selection</span> - Doubly RESOLVED. With JDK 1.6, NB6 uses your platform's browser by default, and the setting has been moved to the basic settings dialog.</li><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">NetBeans is a goofy name</span> - UNRESOLVABLE. There's too much branding and history behind the NetBeans name to change it, or so I'm told. Oh well, at least it's not limiting in any way, and it does have a nice mouthfeel to it unlike "Visual Studio 2005".</li><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Eclipse keybindings</span> - OPEN, but workable. The default Eclipse keybindings are missing some important ones, but you can go map them yourself easily enough. Unfortunately there's no equivalent to Ctrl-Shift-R, which is like a "super open" for any file in the workspace. I also haven't found an outline view shortcut like Ctrl-O, which hurts a bit.</li><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Sorted members view</span> - OPEN. However I can deal with the default sorting for now.</li><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Show packages as a hierarchy</span> - OPEN, but I've been using the Files view almost exclusively which already uses a hierarchy.</li><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Anti-aliased UI</span> - RESOLVED! Under JDK 1.6, UI elements are also antialiased! It looks great!</li><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Collapsing comments</span> - RESOLVED, but one bug. It turns out that only the large license block at the top of our JRuby source files refuses to collapse. Everything else, including JavaDocs and multi-line comments, collapses ok. Probably a bug in how NB determines what comments to collapse.</li><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Improved coloration</span> - RESOLVED SOON. <a href="http://blogs.sun.com/jlahoda/entry/new_features_in_netbeans_ide">Better coloration and other editor improvements</a> are planned for NB6.</li><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Memory usage</span> - OPEN, but improved. NetBeans 6 is a little better, but still typically takes over 200MB and sometimes over 300MB of memory. Eclipse usually stays under 200MB for me. However I don't have any modules disabled, and NB6 comes with UI design, Java EE, DB support, XML support, Web design support and a ton of other stuff out-of-the-box. That balances things out a <span style="font-weight: bold;">lot</span>.</li><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">FIXME support</span> - RESOLVED via external module. The <a href="http://tasklist.netbeans.org">NetBeans Tasklist</a> looks quite a bit more sophisticated than Eclipse's support.</li><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Clear search results</span> - OPEN, but workable. Search for nothing and the results clear. However I conversed with Roman Strobl, NetBeans Evangelist, and he agreed that was a little cumbersome.</li><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Right-click editor menu with SCM operations</span> - RESOLVED. You can't get those options right-clicking in the editor, but you can right-click the editor tab for the same effect. Hooray!</li><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Odd behavior of SVN menus in file view</span> - RESOLVED. This and several other SVN issues I ran into appear to have been fixed in recent 5.5 and 6.0 development builds. Subversion support seems to be tighter in NB6, or so it seems.</li><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Slow start-up</span> - OPEN, but fading fast. It's not a large perceptible difference between Eclipse and NetBeans now, and NetBeans is loading a lot more stuff. It's very nearly RESOLVED.</li></ol>Hopefully it's apparent that NetBeans is arriving fast. If I were to make predictions, I'd say that NetBeans 5.5 will be a really powerful and useful release, especially considering suport for Java SE 5 and Java EE 5 out-of-the-box. I believe the bugs I've encountered will be wrapped up, and 5.5 will be a compelling alternative to "Eclipse-plus-ten-thousand-plugins", which functionality it easily matches.<br /><br />I would also predict that NB6 may finally be the big release that surpasses Eclipse for day-one usability and functionality. There's just so much packed into the base product, I don't think Eclipse itself is even a fair comparison. WSAD may be the only real competitor at that point, and I'd prefer not to run that monster (and I also prefer not to use WebSphere.)<br /><br />One area I think NetBeans needs to improve is in making development releases easily available. I have to dig down through multiple pages, dropdowns and license-acceptance forms to get at the 5.5 and 6.0 dev releases, which have so far been very stable and very nice. To save some time, here's a link to the <a href="http://www.netbeans.info/downloads/download.php?a=n&amp;p=1">NetBeans Download</a> form. "Daily" builds are obvious enough, but I believe "Q-Build" builds are probably "QA" builds, perhaps equivalent to Eclipse's "integration builds" or "milestones". Q-Builds might be a good place to get started for you Pro users out there.
