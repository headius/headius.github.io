Ok, so this post is as much for me as for you (so I have a post to refer back to) but some of you may be interested to know what conferences I'll be at. Things have gotten a bit busier since the Sun announcement.<span style="font-weight: bold;"><br /><br /><a href="http://barcampmilwaukee.com/index.php?title=Main_Page">BarCamp Milwaukee</a></span> - September 30 - October 1, Milwaukee WI<br /><br />I <span style="font-style: italic;">may</span> make the trip down to Milwaukee for their upcoming BarCamp. Hopefully others from the cities will be willing to make the trip with me (and drive :), or I probably won't go.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;"><a href="http://www.rubyconf.com/">RubyConf 2006</a></span> - October 20-22, Denver CO<br /><br />Not presenting, but I'll be there and will probably try to organize a lightning session or something.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;"><a href="http://www.gatewayjug.org/index.htm">Gateway JUG</a></span> - November 7, St Louis MO<br /><br />The Gateway JUG has offered to fly me in for a JRuby-fest at their November 7 meeting. It ought to be a good sharing of ideas and meeting of the minds. Try visiting the <a href="http://www.gatewayjug.org/index.htm">Gateway JUG website</a> if you might be interested in showing up for the meeting.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;"><a href="http://www.twincitiescodecamp.com/TCCC/Default.aspx">TC Code Camp</a></span> - November 11, Bloomington MN<br /><br />I'll be presenting JRuby and JRuby-related topics to coders at Microsoft's Bloomington campus.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;"><a href="http://www.javapolis.com/">JavaPolis 2006</a></span> - December 11-15, Antwerp, Belgium<br /><br />Tom and I are officially on the schedule to present JRuby (on Rails, perhaps) at JavaPolis 2006. We'll follow that up with our Great Belgian Beer Tour, sampling brews in the Belgian backcountry. What could be better than that?
