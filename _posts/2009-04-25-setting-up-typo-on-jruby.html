I figured I'd give Typo a try on JRuby today. It has been working for quite a while, but with the GlassFish gem improving so much I thought it would be good to write up an updated walkthrough. It's pretty simple.<br /><br />BTW, is Typo still the preeminent blog package for Rails? I certainly don't want to be out of fashion.<br /><br />Prerequisites:<div><ol><li>MySQL already set up and working, with TCP sockets enabled (or I guess you can use SQLite too)</li><li>Java (sudo apt-get install sun-java6-jdk or whatever's appropriate for your platform)</li><li>JRuby (<a href="http://dist.codehaus.org/jruby/1.2.0/jruby-bin-1.2.0.zip">download</a>, unpack, put bin/ in PATH)</li><li>Appropriate gems installed (rails, activerecord-jdbcmysql-adapter, glassfish or mongrel)</li></ol><div>The process:</div><div><ol><li><a href="http://rubyforge.org/frs/?group_id=555&amp;release_id=32721">Download Typo</a>. The gem unfortunately tries to install native extensions like sqlite3 and mysql (I sure wish they wouldn't do that!)</li><li>Unpack the Typo zip wherever you want your blog site to live and cd into that directory</li><li>Edit config/database.yml.example to your liking, replacing "mysql" with "jdbcmysql" and save it as config/database.yml</li><li>Create the database:<br /><pre>jruby -S rake db:create RAILS_ENV=production</pre></li><li>Migrate the database:<br /><pre>jruby -S rake db:migrate RAILS_ENV=production</pre></li><li>Run the server:<br /><pre>glassfish -p &lt;port&gt; -e production [and whatever other options you want]</pre> or<br /><pre>jruby script/server -p &lt;port&gt; -e production</pre></li><li><a href="http://blog.headius.com/2009/04/apache-jruby-rails-glassfish-easy.html">Set up Apache to point at your new Typo instance</a> (optional)</li></ol><div>That's all there is to it! You'll want to be the first one to hit your new blog, so you can set up your admin account and lock down the server.</div><div><br /></div><div>Perhaps it's time I finally moved my blog off Blogger and on to a JRuby-hosted server, eh?</div><div><br /></div><div>Suggestions, improvements to this process? Add to comments and I'll update the post.</div></div></div>
