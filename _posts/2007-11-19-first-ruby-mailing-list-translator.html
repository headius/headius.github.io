In response to my post about the <a href="http://headius.blogspot.com/2007/11/ruby-community-seeks-autotranslator.html">Ruby community needing an autotranslator</a> for the key mailing lists, due to the language barrier between English-speaking and Japanese-speaking folks, I received quite a bit of interest, and a few people are looking into automatic solutions, manual solutions, and various solutions in between. But I believe we have a first attempt to meet the challenge.<br /><br />Jason Toy has set up a <a href="http:/translator.rubynow.com">mailing list translator site for the Ruby community</a>. It provides autotranslated text of many Ruby mailing lists (both directions, and far more than I expected anyone to tackle), and even better it provides the original text and invites bilingual Rubyists to submit better translations for individual posts.<br /><br />Jason commented on the previous post, saying his site still needs some work, but it's definitely on the right track. The obvious missing feature is a way to subscribe to the translated lists, either via feeds or mailing lists. Anyone feel like lending a hand can contact Jason at (I think) <a href="mailto:admin@translator.rubynow.com">admin@translator.rubynow.com</a>. Anyone feeling like doing this one better, maybe by setting up an army of human translators to proxy information across the divide, don't let this stop you :)
