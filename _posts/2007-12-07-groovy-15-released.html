The Groovy team has kicked out their second major production release, <a href="http://docs.codehaus.org/display/GROOVY/2007/12/07/Groovy+1.5+released">Groovy 1.5</a>...and skipped straight from 1.0 to 1.5. Why? Perhaps because they added generics, enums, static imports, annotations, fully dynamic metaclasses, improved performance, ... and much more. I think the move to 1.5 was certainly warranted, and we've been considering making the next JRuby release 1.5 for the same reasons.<br /><br />Congratulations to the Groovy team! I'm looking forward to seeing 1.6 and 2.0 in the future!
