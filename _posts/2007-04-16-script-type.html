Remember way back when the IRB applet was first thrust upon the world, and I promised that you truly could now use Ruby in the browser? At the time, it was still a little cumbersome, and generally you could only use Ruby by passing it directly into the applet.<br /><br />Well Dion Almaer has taken it to the next awesome step:<br /><br /><a href="http://www.almaer.com/blog/archives/001455.html">&lt;script type="text/ruby"&gt;</a><br /><br />Check out his blog entry on how to enable true Ruby scripting on the client side, as well as the <a href="http://ruby-in-browser.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/evalruby/index.html">link to his demo page</a> (still loads up the applet in the background, but that's a minor implementation detail).<br /><br />Awesome.
