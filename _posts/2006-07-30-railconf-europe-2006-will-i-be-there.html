Well now I've gone and done it.<br />

<br /><blockquote>Dear Charles,<br /><br />We are pleased to inform you that your RailsConf Europe 2006 presentation proposal:<br /><br />JRuby on Rails<br /><br />has been accepted, and will be included in one of the conference tracks.</blockquote><br /><br />So there's only two problems now:<br /><br />- I'm not funded through any source for RailsConf Europe.<br />- I have to spend the next month (working with the other contributors) making Rails run well enough to be presentable.<br /><br />Blast it all...now I have to start picking and choosing at which venues I will speak. Why's it got to be so <span style="font-weight:bold;">complicated</span>?
