The headline says it all, really!<br /><br />The <a href="http://www.tiobe.com/tpci.htm">TIOBE Programming Community Index</a> measures language popularity based on "the world-wide availability of  skilled engineers, courses and third party vendors" using the major search engines. It's not not a terribly scientific way to measure popularity, but I'm not sure anyone has a better index.<br /><br />Ruby has been moving up every month during 2006 and for the first time has broken the top ten in January 2007. TIOBE also declared it the "Programming Language of 2006", which comes as no surprise to us Rubyists who love the language so much.<br /><br />Congratulations, Ruby!
