Some of the local Rubyists and I were talking about publishers for a future JRuby book...ligers were brought up...and, well, <a href="http://weblog.halogenlabs.com/posts/i-caught-you-a-delicious-bass/">here's the result</a>.<br />

<br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://halogenlabs.com/images/jruby.jpg"><img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer;" src="http://halogenlabs.com/images/jruby_th.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a><br /><br />It's just perfect...the lion of Java mated with the tiger of Ruby...and the magical JRuby is their offspring. It brings a tear to your eye, doesn't it?<br /><br />Feel free to <a href="http://digg.com/programming/JRuby_s_O_Reilly_book_to_feature_a_Liger_on_the_cover">digg it</a>.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">Update:</span> A couple folks have noted that O'Reilly's Java animal is already a tiger, so I guess I've got the roles reversed!
