This year, no major Ruby organization got accepted to Google's Summer of Code (even though a half dozen Python projects got accepted, but I won't rant here). What do we as Rubyists do? Take it sitting down? NO! We make our own Summer of Code!<br /><br />Thanks to Engine Yard, Ruby Central, and the Rails team, Ruby Summer of Code has raised $100k in just three days, allowing us to run 20 student projects! Hooray!<br /><br /><a href="http://rubysoc.org/">Ruby Summer of Code</a><br /><br />Now of course we really would love to have some JRuby projects involved. There's so much exciting stuff going on with JRuby, and I believe it's the most promising platform for really growing the Ruby community. So we've set up a page for <a href="http://kenai.com/projects/jruby/pages/RubySummerOfCode2010">JRuby Ruby Summer of Code 2010</a> ideas. Here's a few to get you started:<br /><ul><li>JRuby on Android work, including command-line tooling, performance work, and all the little bits and pieces needed to make Ruby a first-class Android language.</li><li>Porting key C extensions to JRuby, so there's an alternative for people migrating.</li><li>A super-fast lightweight server similar to the GlassFish gem.</li><li>A full Hibernate and/or JPA backend for DataMapper or DataObjects, so that all databases Hibernate supports "just work" with JRuby.</li><li>Work on JRuby's nascent suport for Ruby C extensions by building the API out</li><li>Help get JRuby's early optimizing compiler wired up, to take JRuby's perf to the next level</li><li>Duby-related projects, like IDE support, better tooling, codebase cleanup, features, documentation.</li></ul>And there's dozens of other projects out there just waiting for you! Add yourself as a student on the <a href="http://rubysoc.org/">RubySOC page</a>, add some ideas to the <a href="http://kenai.com/projects/jruby/pages/RubySummerOfCode2010">JRuby ideas page</a>, and let's get hacking!
