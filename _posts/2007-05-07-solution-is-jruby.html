Big news today from ThoughtWorks Studios! Their collaborative development project management solution <a href="http://studios.thoughtworks.com/mingle-project-intelligence">Mingle</a> (think SourceForge, but pretty and usable) will be the first commercially-distributed Rails application to run on <a href="http://www.jruby.org">JRuby</a>. <a href="http://studios.thoughtworks.com/2007/5/7/mingle-to-run-on-jruby">Jon Tirsen summarizes the justification</a> for this move in a Studios blog post.<br /><br />The reasons are obvious ones to those of us who've poured our hearts and souls into making JRuby succeed, but they're excellent points to call out for the Ruby community at large. Mingle 1.0 will be released running with a Jetty web front-end and a Derby database back-end. Mingle 1.1 will be released as a WAR file (Rails-in-a-WAR courtesy of <a href="http://rubyforge.org/projects/jruby-extras">GoldSpike</a>) targeting any app server and any database.<br /><br />This is a big day for JRuby. ThoughtWorks is one of the most respected names in the Ruby world, and we're proud that they've chosen JRuby as their enterprise deployment solution. We're happy to have ThoughtWorkers like Ola Bini on the team, and look forward to collaborating with ThoughtWorks to continue improving JRuby into the future.
