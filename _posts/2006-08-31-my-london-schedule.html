So here's the times and places. I want to get together JRubyists to just chat a bit at some point, and it seems like Thursday or Friday would work best. The only concrete suggestion so far is the Fitzroy Tavern on the 15th, around 6:30PM-7:00PM (thanks Damian). This works for me, and it's after the conference. Here's a goofy <a href="http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?f=d&hl=en&amp;saddr=WC1B+3LS&daddr=W1T+2NA&amp;ie=UTF8&z=15&amp;om=1">Google Map to Fitzroy</a> from the conference center.<br /><br />I'm also planning to attend the "<a href="http://pizzaonrails.com/">Pizza on Rails</a>" event on the 13th, so folks can find me there.<br /><br />I'll keep this entry updated as things come in, so it can be used for reference.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">13 September, 6:00AM: Arrival in London (Heathrow)</span><br /><br />Other than getting checked into the hotel, I have that whole day free. I don't plan to cram for my presentation or anything, since it's not until Friday (and I don't really work that way). To avoid the lag I'll probably sleep as much as I can on the plane. Getting out and about once I get there ought to get the circadians whipped into shape.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">13 September, 6</span><span style="font-weight: bold;">:00</span><span style="font-weight: bold;">PM: Pizza on Rails</span><br /><br />Pizza on Rails is around 6PM, with pizza at 7PM.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">14 September, 9</span><span style="font-weight: bold;">:00</span><span style="font-weight: bold;">AM: RailsConf Day One</span><br /><br />The "Welcome" is at 9, and it goes straight through until 8:30PM with a lunch break from 12:30PM to 2:00PM and a dinner break from 5:50PM to 7:30PM. I'll probably try to grab meals with folks from the conf.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">15 September, 9:30AM: RailsConf Day Two</span><br /><br />Lunch break is the same as Day One, and the conf is scheduled to go through until 6PM, with "Closing Remarks" coming after that. Probably be out by 6:30, and the Fitzroy is pretty close. Maybe someone not going to the conf can get there early to scope it out.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">15 September, 3:00PM: JRuby on Rails</span><br /><br />I'm in the last set of speakers, before the final plenary session with James Duncan Davidson and Dave Thomas. I'm up against cleaning up rails, adding unicode to rails, and project management for rails. I wish I could attend the unicode session, but I'll try to grab Dominic offline.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">15 September, 6:30PM: JRuby Meetup</span><br /><br />So far I think we'll just be at Fitzroy Tavern, as mentioned at the top of this post. All are welcome...I don't fly out until 1:25PM the next day, so I can stick around for a while.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">16 September 10:00AM: Departure</span><br /><br />Given the recent TERROR scare, I'm going to be extra careful and head to the airport nice and early. I'm not particularly worried about TERROR, but I am over-cautious about giving security enough time to scour my person for soda pop and lip balm.<br /><br />Thus ends my first trip to London. It's too bad it will be so short, but I have business to attend to stateside immediately after the conference. Hopefully I'll stop back in when I'm in the EU for JavaPolis.<br /><br />I hope to see plenty of JRubyists in London!
