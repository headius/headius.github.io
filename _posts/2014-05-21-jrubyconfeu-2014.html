<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">I'm thrilled to announce that we'll have another edition of <a href="http://2014.jrubyconf.eu/">JRubyConf.eu</a>&nbsp;this year!<br /><br /><a href="http://2013.jrubyconf.eu/">Last year's event</a> was a great success. We had a two-day conference in Berlin immediately before <a href="http://2013.eurucamp.org/">Eurucamp 2013</a>, with two speakers from the core team (myself and <a href="http://twitter.com/tom_enebo">Tom Enebo</a>) and a whopping <b>fifteen</b>&nbsp;non-core speakers. A great event was had by all.<br /><br />This year, we've decided to pull the event back to its roots, as part of <a href="http://2014.eurucamp.org/">Eurucamp 2014</a>. We'll return to the single-track, single-day event co-located with and immediately preceding Eurucamp on 1st August. We really wanted to bring JRuby back to Rubyists, and we're looking forward to hanging out at Eurucamp the whole weekend!<br /><br />Why not visit Eurucamp early and spend a day learning about JRuby with the best JRubyists in Europe?<br /><br />If you're interested in attending, tickets are available for only â‚¬99 at the <a href="http://tickets.eurucamp.org/">Eurucamp ticket site</a> now!<br /><br />We're also looking for speakers from the JRuby community. You can submit to the CFP (which ends Sunday 28 May) using the <a href="http://cfp.eurucamp.org/">Eurucamp CFP app</a>.<br /><br />Looking forward to seeing you at JRubyConf and Eurucamp this summer!</div>
