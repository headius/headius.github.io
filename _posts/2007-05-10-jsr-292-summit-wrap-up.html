Today Tom and I met with fellow language implementers Oti Humbel, Charlie Groves, and Tobias Ivarsson to start discussions about JSR-292 (invokedynamic) with John Rose, longtime VM implementer and new spec lead. It was an excellent discussion, with John listening patiently to the implementation challenges we've had on JRuby and Jython and offering suggestions. He took copious notes and posted them <a href="http://blogs.sun.com/jrose/entry/jsr_292_deep_dive_notes">here</a>.<br /><br />We have the second edition of the JRuby on Rails talk tomorrow morning, so I'm signing out now. But check out John's post, it's a great first look at a promising start on 292 work.
