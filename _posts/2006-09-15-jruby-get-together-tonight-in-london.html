Yes, today is the day! We will be getting JRubyists together at the Fitzroy near the RailsConf conference center.<br /><br />Here's a <a href="http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?f=d&hl=en&saddr=WC1B+3LS&daddr=W1T+2NA&ie=UTF8&z=15&om=1">gmap to the Fitzroy</a>. Show up around 6:30-7:00PM and I'll be there!
