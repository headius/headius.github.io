I just completed my talk at Tech Days Hyderabad, and I think it was  resounding success. If I heard right, the total head count for my "JRuby Essentials" talk was over 1200 people, by far the largest crowd I've presented for. There was a hoard of questioners immediately after the talk, who followed me into the hall to keep asking. I gave out my entire in-pocket batch of business cards, and even received a round of applause after the JRuby on Rails demo. All this even after my talk was delayed and cut to 40 minutes because the earlier talks ran too long. It was a sprint, but I think it went very well.<br /><br />I will be posting the slides, but they're basically the same content many of you have probably seen the past couple months. For those who haven't had the pleasure, we'll start posting slides more regularly, and I'll try to blog a few example walkthroughs for those of you who want to duplicate them for your own talks. Feel free to steal it all and spread the word.
