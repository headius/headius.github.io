I've posted about TIOBE here before.<br /><blockquote>The TIOBE Programming Community index gives an indication of the popularity of programming  languages. The index is updated once a month. The ratings are based on the world-wide availability of  skilled engineers, courses and third party vendors. The popular search engines Google, MSN, Yahoo!, and YouTube are used to calculate the ratings. Observe that the TIOBE index is not about the <i>best</i> programming  language or the language in which <i>most lines of code</i> have been written.</blockquote><br />I noticed this month that Ruby has moved up to #9 in the list, passing JavaScript. Also noted in the November Newsflash is that Ruby is currently the front runner to win "programming language of the year" for the second year in a row, closely followed by D and C#.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.tiobe.com/index.htm?tiobe_index">TIOBE Programming Community Index</a>
